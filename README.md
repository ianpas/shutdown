# Motivation
It's necessary to have your own armory in programming, and a component library is a good start point. Due to lack of real working experience, I'm not familiar with using react in production environment, thus this project is what I can do when I'm alone. 

The goal of the project is to ultimately build my own component library, one thing that I know the ins and outs. Currently, I implemented only a few basic components, however, that's enough to sketch the outline.

For css part, I learned a lot from bootstrap and use some code of it directly. For API part, references are ant-design and material-ui.

# Homepage

As it's not production ready, I decided to just build a homepage these days with this library, instead of publishing a package.
